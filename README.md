# Game Programming Assignment 3
This assignment is to create a simple 2D platformer using what was learned in the previous assignments. It also introduces jumping mechanics and scene management. A fair warning, the sound effects are a little loud.

To run the game, open the build folder and run the Assignment3.exe file. However, to exit the build of the game, you will have to close the program manually which you can do from either the taskbar or task manager.

To view the project in the Unity editor, open the Assignment3 folder using UnityHub to open it as a project.
